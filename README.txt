CLOSED xml game engine
-------------------------------
This repo contains the source code of a project realized on 2011 at  
FIB (Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona) by Jordi Castells and Sandra del Moral.

--What?--
CLOSED is a small game engine to create point and click games for Android phones
using XML files.

--Tested--
It was tested on an HTC-dream and HTC-Hero using Android 1.5. Later tested on
an Android 2.0 environment.

--Status--
The project is stopped and no longer developed :-) 
I retrieved the code from a subversion repo and added here in github, If somebody
wants to play with it, here it is.
